## 📥 How to Add Your Logo Image

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. **Right-click** on the logo image you showed me

## 🔧 Alternative: If You Want a Different File Name

If you want to use a different filename (like `vision-logo.png`), just:

1. Save your image with that name
2. Open each HTML file
3. Find: `<img src="logo.png"`
4. Replace with: `<img src="your-filename.png"`
